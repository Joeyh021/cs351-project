Our goal is to expand on the prior work of current hardware devices and
use Chisel to build open source programmable I/O devices, integrated with
Rocket RISC-V cores to create a complete microcontroller. Implementation will
target FPGAs, as this allows for rapid prototyping and easy implementation
and testing of hardware. The requirements for the I/O device are summarised
below.
• The device should be implemented using Chisel
• The device should have a small instruction memory for holding programs
• The device should be programmable using a simple DSL
• The device should execute instructions from it’s memory in a standard
fetch-decode-execute fashion
• Instructions should execute within a single cycle
• Instructions should either push data to the output pins, or shift data in
from the pins
• The device should contain an interface for streaming data to/from a host
device or external memory
8
• The device should be able to flexibly map inputs and outputs to external
GPIO pins on the FPGA
The secondary goal, once the HDL implementation is complete and all require-
ments above are fulfilled, is to build a microcontroller integrating the devices
using Rocket Chip. The requirements for this are summarised below.
• The microcontroller should contain at least one CPU core, programmable
using the RISC-V ISA
• The microcontroller should be capable of executing instructions inde-
pendently from the device
• The microcontroller should connect to the device over some bus, and be
able to share data via a common memory or some other bus communic-
ation protocol
• The microcontroller should be capable of acting as a host for the devices,
controlling initialisation and handling interrupts
• The microcontroller should be compact and efficient, using as little FPGA
resources and power as possible
