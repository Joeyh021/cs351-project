    Traditionally, general-purpose embedded systems necessitate the inclusion of multiple hardware interfaces such as I2C, SPI, and UART, to allow interfacing with a variety of devices. 

    We explore Programmable I/O as an alternative: flexible and highly performant I/O devices that allow for communication at high-speed using whatever protocol a programmer wishes into implement. We then integrate PIO into open-source RISC-V cores to creates a flexible and compact MCU that can be used in applications where adaptable or custom interfaces are required without the need for custom hardware.

    Through this we also evalute Chisel, a novel hardware description language, and find it to be a compelling alternative to Verilog.
