\section{Introduction}

Traditionally, general-purpose microcontrollers necessitate the inclusion of a wide variety of hardware interfaces such as UART, SPI, and I2C to interface with a broad range of peripherals. Each of these interfaces has different hardware requirements, and is costly in development time, chip area, and system power. These interfaces are often emulated over general-purpose I/O interfaces using software techniques, but such techniques are usually inefficient and have poor performance.

The aim of this project is to develop state machine-based programmable I/O blocks which are able to implement any communication protocol, which will then be integrated with open-source RISC-V cores to create a flexible and compact microcontroller.

\section{Background}

Embedded systems require hardware to receive input from and send output to the real world, and general-purpose microcontrollers include multiple hardware buses for different purposes to enable interfacing with the widest possible variety of peripherals, meaning systems often end up including lots of hardware that is unused, or not having enough hardware of a specific kind. Furthermore, each bus consumes space and power on a chip, and costs to design and manufacture, making microcontrollers larger, more expensive, and less efficient than they often need to be.

Programmable I/O attempts to solve this by acting as a flexible hardware interface for embedded systems. PIO as implemented in the Raspberry Pi RP2040 contains programmable state machines which operate by shifting data to/from output pins. The devices are programmed using pioasm, a simple assembly-like DSL that define how data should be moved into/out of the device \cite{rp2040}. The intention of this project is to develop devices similar to these to tackle the problem of embedded I/O.

Through developing these devices we also intend to explore Chisel, a hardware description language embedded in Scala. Traditional HDLs such as Verilog and VHDL are old and unergonomic, having been originally designed for simulation (not synthesis), and lacking many features that are common in modern programming languages. Chisel takes advantage of the modern features and functional style of Scala, and existing JVM tooling and infrastructure to proide a much more ergonomic and flexible language and development process. Chisel compiles to Verilog, making it compatible with existing FPGA workflows and toolchains.

Rocket Chip is an library of hardware components for generating RISC-V SoCs, and leverages Chisel to provide extensive parametrisation and flexibility. The customisability of Rocket Chip makes it an ideal candidate for experimentation, and it will be used to provide CPU cores for integrating with our custom I/O devices to build a full microcontroller.

\section{Progress \& Current Work}

As it stands, the state of the project is approximately 2 weeks behind the timeline as described in table \ref{tab:timeline} of the original specification. Some time has been spent learning Chisel and Scala, and figuring out workflows to integrate Chisel with traditional Xilinx FPGA workflows and toolchains. Proof-of-concept I/O devices have been implemented using Chisel, both standalone and integrated with Rocket Cores over AXI-lite buses.

As an example, listing \ref{blink} shows a proof-of-concept Chisel module with an \txt{enable} input, and an output \txt{led0} which is designed to be connected to an output LED. A counter, a standard library component, is used to create a clock divider such that the LED is toggled every time the counter wraps around back to 0. The module is parametrised over two values which are chosen at compile time: the input clock speed, and the speed at which the LED blinks. Input clock and reset are implicit in Chisel modules: all the logic for resetting register values and moving values on clock edges is implicit and generated automatically.


\begin{listing}[ht!]
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\begin{minted}{Scala}

class Blink(clockSpeed: Int = 100_000_000, speed: Int = 1) 
  extends Module {
    val io = IO(new Bundle {
      val led0   = Output(Bool())
      val enable = Input(Bool())
  })
  
  val led = RegInit(true.B)
  io.led0 := led
  
  val (_, counterWrap) = Counter(true.B, clockSpeed / speed)
  when(counterWrap && io.enable) {
    led := ~led
  }
}
    \end{minted}
	\caption{Scala to generate Verilog from a Chisel module}
	\label{blink}
\end{listing}


Working with Chisel in Vivado is not as easy as working with Verilog, as Vivado has no native support for Scala. Chisel projects are instead managed as Scala projects using sbt, which handles dependencies such as the Chisel and ChiselTest libraries, and provides support for compiling, running and testing Scala projects from the command line. We have been compiling Chisel to Verilog, which is done by providing a \mintinline{text}{Main} object containing code to instantiate the top-level Chisel module, and then passing it to a call to \mintinline{text}{emitVerilog()}. Listing \ref{chiselmain} shows \mintinline{text}{Main.scala} from our project, creating the example Blink module and placing the compiled Verilog into the \mintinline{text}{/gen} directory containing all generated code. Invoked from the command line, \mintinline{text}{sbt run} will compile all the Scala sources, and then invoke the Chisel compiler to generate the Verilog.

\begin{listing}[]
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\begin{minted}{Scala}
import chisel3.stage.ChiselStage

object Main extends App {
  val defaultArgs = Array("--target-dir", "/gen")
  (new ChiselStage).emitVerilog(new blinky.Blink,
  defaultArgs ++ args)
}
    \end{minted}
	\caption{Scala to generate Verilog from a Chisel module}
	\label{chiselmain}
\end{listing}

The compiled Verilog can be imported into Vivado like any other HDL files. We have found it most convenient to specify the "do not copy sources into project" option when doing so, as this means that when the Chisel code is changed and Verilog re-compiled, the imported HDL will update in Vivado without any intervention.

The full suite of Vivado tooling is then available for working with the HDL as usual. Figure \ref{fig:rtl} shows the RTL schematic for the Chisel module in listing \ref{blink}. The reported utilisation of the design is 10 LUTs and 28 flip-flops, with a total on-chip power usage of 0.236 Watts. These numbers are similar to those reported of an equivalent native Verilog design, demonstrating that the Chisel compiler is capable of generating compact and efficient circuits.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../img/blinky-rtl.png}
	\caption{The RTL schematic generated by listing \ref{blink}}
	\label{fig:rtl}
\end{figure}


The time spent working on this has been valuable. Writing HDL in Chisel is very different to Verilog and will take a while to become familiar with, and the setting up a simple and ergonomic workflow for writing Chisel, compiling to Verilog, and then importing it into Vivado took time to figure out. Having spent time on this now means we will be able to focus more on development and implementation when it comes to that, as we are already familiar with the tools.

\section{Updated Timeline}

Work has not yet started on designing the intended I/O devices themselves, the position we had hoped to be in as of Week 6. This is due to having spent longer working with prototypes and getting to grips with tooling, and also having underestimated the amount of other coursework that has prevented work from taking place on the project. This is likely to remain the situation until the end of term when all other coursework has finished and progress can resume.

Plans are in place to reduce the scope of the project if necessary: instead of spending time integrating the devices with CPU cores, it can designed to work standalone without integrating with any other components on the FPGA. This removes the extra complexity introduced by communicating within an SoC over AXI buses or similar, and allows to focus solely on the design of the device.

An updated timeline is provided in table \ref{tab:timeline2} to reflect how we expect the rest of the project to progress. It starts from Week 12, as this is the earliest point at which we expect to be able to resume work. Should the scope of the project need to be reduced as discussed above, the tasks for weeks 21-24 can be removed/reduced to give more time.

\end{table}

% discuss each item in more detail
% already done full project flow, how that support this
% explain how we provide skeleton and the bulk of the work is just filling in blanks

Designing the system on a high level first by laying out a block design provides two advantages: the design will be very thoroughly documented, and it will also be easy to begin implementation as there will be a strong starting point. As the design is based heavily on the RP2040, we can draw upon diagrams such as figures \ref{fig:pio-block} and \ref{fig:pio-sm} to inform the design.

The block design will then be expanded out into a project skeleton in Chisel, creating stub modules for each component and laying out a project structure in code. During this stage, we also intend to define the ports for each module and the interfaces/connections between modules.

Once the block design and project skeleton are complete, we intend to implement modules starting with the simpler ones such as clock dividers and FIFOs, before moving on to more complex bits such as pin mapping, instruction decoders and execution engines. The detailed project skeleton and block design will hopefully make just a task of filling in the blanks, writing code to an already detailed specification. Having already written some Chisel and developed workflows will make this easier also, and allow me to focus on the design rather than on learning the tools and processes.

This approach would allow someone else to pick up the project should it not be completed, as it would be well documented and there would be a well-defined starting point within the project codebase. If time permits, we would also like to write our own pioasm assembler, as this would help gain a richer understanding of how the system works.

Testing will be an iterative process, writing testbenches for each module alongside the module itself, and utilising test-driven development for strong functional verification. Integration testing will take place towards the end of the development process when the device is starting to come together, but this is subject to how development progresses: it may be possible to run some tests earlier, both in simulation and in hardware.

Only once the devices themselves are complete will Rocket Chip be considered, integrating the hardware we have developed with the existing RISC-V cores to create a microcontroller and performing tests on it to verify functionality.

\section{Project Management}

So far, besides the project falling behind timeline, project management has been good: tasks have been kept track of and progress logged. We have created a Kanban board using GitHub Projects, and added each task from the timeline to it. Cards are categorised as "To Do", "In Progress", or "Done", with some also being under "Blocked" if they're waiting on completion of another card, or put to the side to do later. Extra cards are added ad-hoc if extra tasks come up.

Each card can be converted to an "Issue" on GitHub and added to a repository, and checklists and other commentory associated with how the progress of the task can be added. Resources used and Git commits and code associated with the progress or completion of the task can also be linked to. Figure \ref{fig:kanban} shows the state of the Kanban board as of Week 7, and the live version can be found at \url{https://github.com/users/Joeyh021/projects/2}

\section{Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues}

As discussed in the original specification, there are some legal issues to consider, as we are developing hardware similar to other commercial hardware. Appropriate care has so far been taken to ensure that our devices are sufficiently distinct from said hardware, as not to infringe upon the revelant intellectual property laws.

Other issues have continued to be considered and none more have come up in the course of the project so far.

\appendix
\section{Original Specification}

\subsection{Background \& Prior Work}

\subsubsection{Embedded Systems Interfaces}

The primary purpose of embedded systems and microcontrollers is usually to interact with the real world via sensors, actuators, LEDs, speakers, etc, but communicating with such hardware can be difficult due to the need for high frequencies and precise timing requirements. Computers and microcontrollers include dedicated hardware for high-speed interfaces: SATA and PCIe are common in desktop-class hardware and used to interface with consumer hardware, but interfaces such as UART, SPI, I2C, PWM and I2S are more general-purpose buses usually found in microcontrollers and designed for use with a wide variety of electronic components. These protocols are also simpler and cheaper (in terms of power, space and money) to implement than the likes of SATA, making them ideal for lower-cost microcontrollers. All of these interfaces have different hardware and software requirements, and the cost and complexity associated with implementing all of these in a device may mean you end up with lots of interfaces you don't need, or not enough of a single type of interface.

A common alternative to using dedicated hardware is to use the CPU to control GPIO pins, implementing the control and timing processes in software: a process known as 'bit-banging'. However, general-purpose software processors are generally not designed to do this, and maintaining precise timing requirements at high speed is very hard, especially when the processor has other work to do. For example, SPI can run at up 100MHz, a speed which is impossible to maintain on most consumer microcontrollers, especially lower-power ones \citep{picosdk}.

The usual solution to custom interface requirements is FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays): programmable hardware devices that can be configured by an engineer to implement whatever hardware they wish. These are very flexible but come at a high price, and there is also still the need for software processor alongside it. 'Soft' CPU cores can be implemented in FPGAs alongside other hardware devices, and some embedded systems such as the Xilinx Zynq SoCs combine traditional ARM processing cores with programmable logic slices, connected over various buses \citep{zynq}. FPGAs also present a very different programming model, as programmers are not writing software but designing hardware.

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../img/pio-block.jpg}
	\caption{A PIO block from the RP2040 \citep{rp2040}}
	\label{fig:pio-block}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Programmable IO}

It is this problem that we intend to tackle: developing a flexible, low cost, easy to use hardware interface for embedded systems. The inspiration for this comes from the RP2040: a dual-core ARM-based microcontroller designed by Raspberry Pi Ltd released in 2021. The flagship feature of the RP2040 is PIO (Programmable I/O blocks): programmable state machine-based devices as described in the introduction above. Two PIO blocks are included in the RP2040, each of which includes 4 state machines, as shown in figure \ref{fig:pio-block}.

The PIO state machines are designed specifically for I/O, able to move data with the speed and timing precision required for high-speed serial I/O interfaces such as SPI, UART and even VGA/DVI. As shown in figure \ref{fig:pio-sm}, each state machine consists of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Two 32-bit shift registers
	\item Two 32-but scratch registers
	\item A fractional clock divider
	\item Flexible GPIO pin mapping
	\item 4x32 bit Rx/Tx FIFOs connected to the system bus, able to sustain up to one word per clock to/from DMA
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../img/rp2040-state-machine.png}
	\caption{An overview of a PIO State Machine \citep{rp2040}}
	\label{fig:pio-sm}
\end{figure}

The state machines are programmed using \texttt{pioasm} (PIO Assembly). An example program is shown in listing \ref{pioasm} to output a simple square wave.

\begin{listing}[b]
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\begin{minted}{asm}

    set pins, 1 [1]  ; Drive pin high then delay for one cycle
    set pins, 0      ; Drive pin low
    jmp again        ; Set PC to label `again`
    \end{minted}
	\caption{PIO Assembly to output a square wave \citep{rp2040}}
	\label{pioasm}
\end{listing}

\subsubsection{Time Processor Units}

Another similar hardware device from which we draw inspiration is the Time Processor Unit (TPU), a device found in some Motorola microcontrollers. The TPU is a coprocessor engine designed to handle complex timing and I/O tasks, independently of the CPU. The TPU consists of a microengine and scheduler for precision timing and execution of instructions, and up to 16 timer channels connected to external pins. Communication with the rest of the system is done via a shared dual-port RAM. Similar to the RP2040, it works by processing and executing microinstructions written by the programmer. Figure \ref{fig:tpu} shows a high-level block diagram of the TPU \citep{tpu}.

\begin{figure}[]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../img/tpu.jpg}
	\caption{An overview of a Time Processor Unit \citep{tpu}}
	\label{fig:tpu}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Chisel \& Rocket Chip}

Another major component of this project will be Chisel and Rocket Chip. Chisel is a hardware description language embedded in the Scala programming language. Traditional HDLs such as Verilog and VHDL were originally designed for simulation, and were only later adopted for use in hardware synthesis. Such languages are also very old, and can be unergonomic when contrasted with modern programming languages and tooling. Chisel takes advantage of the modern features and functional style of Scala, and all the tooling and ecosystem around the JVM to provide a much more ergonomic and extensible development process and experience \citep{chisel}. Chisel is also built on FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation for RTL), a compiler infrastructure for hardware languages that can be used to compile a platform-independent intermediate representation of RTL code into technology-specific RTL, such as Verilog, applying optimisations and specialisations to make the target code more efficient\citep{firrtl}. We intend to explore Chisel as an alternative to Verilog for hardware design, evaluating what aspects of the development process it can improve, and also how easy it is to integrate into traditional FPGA workflows.

Rocket Chip is an open source SoC generator that leverages Chisel to provide a library of hardware generators for RISC-V cores, caches and SoC interconnect. It's extensive parametrisation makes it flexible, and can be used to build anything from embedded microcontrollers to multi-core server class CPUs \citep{rocketchip}. It is easy to add custom components to Rocket Chip, which makes it an ideal candidate for experimentation, and to build out our custom I/O devices into a fully-fledged SoC.


\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../img/rocket-chip.png}
	\caption{A CPU generated using Rocket Chip \citep{rocketchip}}
	\label{fig:rocket}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:rocket} shows an example of a system built using Rocket Chip, and demonstrates the many hardware generators within the framework:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Rocket scalar core and BOOM out-of-order superscalar core are included, both of which optionally include FPUs and have configurable functional unit pipelines and branch predictors.
	\item A variety of cache and TLB generators are included with configurable sizes and associativities.
	\item RoCC, the Rocket Custom Compressor interface, is a template for application specific coprocessors.
	\item Rocket Chip includes the Tile framework for generating custom cache-coherent sub-components, and TileLink for generating interconnect and cache controllers between them.
	\item Generators for AMBA buses are included for communication with external peripherals and controllers \citep{axi}.
\end{itemize}

Rocket Chip-based designs been taped out onto silicon a total of 11 times in a variety of designs and CPUs, using silicon manufacturing processes from STMicroelectronics, Intel and TSMC. Two primary designs have been used: 28nm "Raven" chips, containing a 64-bit RISC-V
vector microprocessor with on-chip switched-capacitor DC-DC converters and adaptive clocking; and also 45nm EOS chips, which feature a dual core 64-bit RISC-V processor \citep{rv2core}. The two designs were used for separate research projects, but shared Rocket Chip code.

Rocket Chip is also a major component of Chipyard: an integrated SoC design, simulation and verification framework designed for agile development of specialised hardware. It includes Rocket Chip, but also accelerators such as the Hwacha vector unit generator and various domain-specific generators for cryptography, digital signal processing, and machine learning \citep{chipyard}.

\subsubsection{FPGAs}

Usually, a microcontroller design such as the one we intend to implement would be fabricated as an ASIC, so it can be integrated into board and other embedded systems. However, this is not an option for us as silicon fabrication is expensive and has to be done at scale. As such, we'll be using FPGAs for implementation. FPGAs are semiconductors based around matrices of configurable logic devices connected via programmable interconnect networks, which which allows them to be configured  \citep{whatisfpga}. This also suits the experimental nature of our project well, as it allows us to iterate on hardware designs and perform testing with relative ease. Chisel can be compiled to verilog designed to map to FPGAs \citep{chisel}, making them ideal for our use.

The hardware we have access to is a Xilinx Artix-7 100T on a Digilent Nexys A7 board \citep{digilent}, containing 15850 programmable logic slices. Preliminary testing has determined that this is enough space to fit a single 64-bit Rocket Core, alongside other interface hardware.

\subsection{Objectives}
Our goal is to expand on the prior work of current hardware devices and use Chisel to build open source programmable I/O devices, integrated with Rocket RISC-V cores to create a complete microcontroller. Implementation will target FPGAs, as this allows for rapid prototyping and easy implementation and testing of hardware. The requirements for the I/O device are summarised below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The device should be implemented using Chisel
	\item The device should have a small instruction memory for holding programs
	\item The device should be programmable using a simple DSL
	\item The device should execute instructions from it's memory in a standard fetch-decode-execute fashion
	\item Instructions should execute within a single cycle
	\item Instructions should either push data to the output pins, or shift data in from the pins
	\item The device should contain an interface for streaming data to/from a host device or external memory
	\item The device should be able to flexibly map inputs and outputs to external GPIO pins on the FPGA
\end{itemize}

The secondary goal, once the HDL implementation is complete and all requirements above are fulfilled, is to build a microcontroller integrating the devices using Rocket Chip. The requirements for this are summarised below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The microcontroller should contain at least one CPU core, programmable using the RISC-V ISA
	\item The microcontroller should be capable of executing instructions independently from the device
	\item The microcontroller should connect to the device over some bus, and be able to share data via a common memory or some other bus communication protocol
	\item The microcontroller should be capable of acting as a host for the devices, controlling initialisation and handling interrupts
	\item The microcontroller should be compact and efficient, using as little FPGA resources and power as possible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Timeline}
\label{sec:timeline}

Table \ref{tab:timeline} gives a rough timeline for the project. Each of the tasks in the table is dependent upon the previous. There are a few notes of context for this:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Week 1 is the start of Term 1
	\item Week 15 is the start of Term 2
	\item The final report is due in Week 31
	\item The project work is weighted more heavily towards term 2, as I am taking more modules in term 1 than term 2.

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Project Timeline}
	\label{tab:timeline}
\end{table}

\subsection{Methodology}

This project is very practical, and the bulk of our time will be spent writing and testing HDL code. As such, an appropriate software engineering methodology is required. Our approach will be very plan based, first laying out a high-level block design on paper, next moving to lay out skeleton HDL code, then writing the code one module at a time. Any iteration on the design will require going back to the block design, necessitating a waterfall-style approach to development. When it comes to implementing each individual module, we intend to take the opposite approach with a very flexible, agile methodology based on extreme programming with constant iteration and testing. This is made easy by the fact that the development team is only one person, and also do not have any external customers or stakeholders besides.

When it comes to testing, we intend to utilised test-driven development (TDD) heavily. Functional verification of hardware is very important, as it's much harder to tell to debug hardware designs than software, and synthesising and testing hardware on an FPGA can be time consuming. ChiselTest is a batteries-included a formal verification framework for Chisel that integrates with ScalaTest, the standard Scala testing framework, and with FIRRTL \citep{chiselverification}. The idea of TDD is that we can use ChiselTest to write the testbench before or alongside the module, and then implement the module with confidence that it works as intended. A comprehensive test suite will allow us to develop iteratively and with confidence.


\subsection{Resources}
There are a few hardware and software resources we'll need access to for completing the project. These are outlined in table \ref{tab:resources}, along with explanations for each. Free, open source software tools and libraries such as Chisel, Scala, and Rocket Chip are not included as they are freely and readily available due to their open source licenses.

\subsection{Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues}

There are some legal issues to consider, as we are developing hardware similar to other commercial hardware. Care must be taken to ensure that the devices we develop are sufficiently distinct from existing implementations, as not to infringe upon the terms of any existing licenses or patents. However, we do not believe this will be a problem for two reasons: our implementation will likely be very rudimentary in comparison, and we do not intend to sell, manufacture, or otherwise profit off any of the outcomes of this project.

Other social, ethical and professional issues have been considered, and there is nothing else to note. As this project does not require working with people, no ethical consent is required.
