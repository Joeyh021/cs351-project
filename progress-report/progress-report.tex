\subsection{Background \& Prior Work}

\subsubsection{Embedded Systems Interfaces}

The primary purpose of embedded systems and microcontrollers is usually to interact with the real world via sensors, actuators, LEDs, speakers, etc, but communicating with such hardware can be difficult due to the need for high frequencies and precise timing requirements. Computers and microcontrollers include dedicated hardware for high-speed interfaces: SATA and PCIe are common in desktop-class hardware and used to interface with consumer hardware, but interfaces such as UART, SPI, I2C, PWM and I2S are more general-purpose buses usually found in microcontrollers and designed for use with a wide variety of electronic components. These protocols are also simpler and cheaper (in terms of power, space and money) to implement than the likes of SATA, making them ideal for lower-cost microcontrollers. All of these interfaces have different hardware and software requirements, and the cost and complexity associated with implementing all of these in a device may mean you end up with lots of interfaces you don't need, or not enough of a single type of interface.

A common alternative to using dedicated hardware is to use the CPU to control GPIO pins, implementing the control and timing processes in software: a process known as 'bit-banging'. However, general-purpose software processors are generally not designed to do this, and maintaining precise timing requirements at high speed is very hard, especially when the processor has other work to do. For example, SPI can run at up 100MHz, a speed which is impossible to maintain on most consumer microcontrollers, especially lower-power ones \citep{picosdk}.

The usual solution to custom interface requirements is FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays): programmable hardware devices that can be configured by an engineer to implement whatever hardware they wish. These are very flexible but come at a high price, and there is also still the need for software processor alongside it. 'Soft' CPU cores can be implemented in FPGAs alongside other hardware devices, and some embedded systems such as the Xilinx Zynq SoCs combine traditional ARM processing cores with programmable logic slices, connected over various buses \citep{zynq}. FPGAs also present a very different programming model, as programmers are not writing software but designing hardware.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Programmable IO}

It is this problem that we intend to tackle: developing a flexible, low cost, easy to use hardware interface for embedded systems. The inspiration for this comes from the RP2040: a dual-core ARM-based microcontroller designed by Raspberry Pi Ltd released in 2021. The flagship feature of the RP2040 is PIO (Programmable I/O blocks): programmable state machine-based devices as described in the introduction above. Two PIO blocks are included in the RP2040, each of which includes 4 state machines, as shown in figure \ref{fig:pio-block}.

The PIO state machines are designed specifically for I/O, able to move data with the speed and timing precision required for high-speed serial I/O interfaces such as SPI, UART and even VGA/DVI. As shown in figure \ref{fig:pio-sm}, each state machine consists of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Two 32-bit shift registers
	\item Two 32-but scratch registers
	\item A fractional clock divider
	\item Flexible GPIO pin mapping
	\item 4x32 bit Rx/Tx FIFOs connected to the system bus, able to sustain up to one word per clock to/from DMA
\end{itemize}

	\caption{An overview of a PIO State Machine \citep{rp2040}}
	\label{fig:pio-sm}
\end{figure}

The state machines are programmed using \texttt{pioasm} (PIO Assembly). An example program is shown in listing \ref{pioasm} to output a simple square wave.

\begin{listing}[b]

	\begin{minted}{asm}
    .program squarewave
    set pindirs, 1   ; Set pin to output
again:
    set pins, 1 [1]  ; Drive pin high then delay for one cycle
    set pins, 0      ; Drive pin low
    jmp again        ; Set PC to label `again`
    \end{minted}

\end{listing}

\subsubsection{Time Processor Units}

Another similar hardware device from which we draw inspiration is the Time Processor Unit (TPU), a device found in some Motorola microcontrollers. The TPU is a coprocessor engine designed to handle complex timing and I/O tasks, independently of the CPU. The TPU consists of a microengine and scheduler for precision timing and execution of instructions, and up to 16 timer channels connected to external pins. Communication with the rest of the system is done via a shared dual-port RAM. Similar to the RP2040, it works by processing and executing microinstructions written by the programmer. Figure \ref{fig:tpu} shows a high-level block diagram of the TPU \citep{tpu}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Chisel \& Rocket Chip}

Another major component of this project will be Chisel and Rocket Chip. Chisel is a hardware description language embedded in the Scala programming language. Traditional HDLs such as Verilog and VHDL were originally designed for simulation, and were only later adopted for use in hardware synthesis. Such languages are also very old, and can be unergonomic when contrasted with modern programming languages and tooling. Chisel takes advantage of the modern features and functional style of Scala, and all the tooling and ecosystem around the JVM to provide a much more ergonomic and extensible development process and experience \citep{chisel}. Chisel is also built on FIRRTL (Flexible Intermediate Representation for RTL), a compiler infrastructure for hardware languages that can be used to compile a platform-independent intermediate representation of RTL code into technology-specific RTL, such as Verilog, applying optimisations and specialisations to make the target code more efficient\citep{firrtl}. We intend to explore Chisel as an alternative to Verilog for hardware design, evaluating what aspects of the development process it can improve, and also how easy it is to integrate into traditional FPGA workflows.

Rocket Chip is an open source SoC generator that leverages Chisel to provide a library of hardware generators for RISC-V cores, caches and SoC interconnect. It's extensive parametrisation makes it flexible, and can be used to build anything from embedded microcontrollers to multi-core server class CPUs \citep{rocketchip}. It is easy to add custom components to Rocket Chip, which makes it an ideal candidate for experimentation, and to build out our custom I/O devices into a fully-fledged SoC.


\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../img/rocket-chip.png}
	\caption{A CPU generated using Rocket Chip \citep{rocketchip}}
	\label{fig:rocket}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:rocket} shows an example of a system built using Rocket Chip, and demonstrates the many hardware generators within the framework:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Rocket scalar core and BOOM out-of-order superscalar core are included, both of which optionally include FPUs and have configurable functional unit pipelines and branch predictors.
	\item A variety of cache and TLB generators are included with configurable sizes and associativities.
	\item RoCC, the Rocket Custom Compressor interface, is a template for application specific coprocessors.
	\item Rocket Chip includes the Tile framework for generating custom cache-coherent sub-components, and TileLink for generating interconnect and cache controllers between them.
	\item Generators for AMBA buses are included for communication with external peripherals and controllers \citep{axi}.
\end{itemize}

Rocket Chip-based designs been taped out onto silicon a total of 11 times in a variety of designs and CPUs, using silicon manufacturing processes from STMicroelectronics, Intel and TSMC. Two primary designs have been used: 28nm "Raven" chips, containing a 64-bit RISC-V
vector microprocessor with on-chip switched-capacitor DC-DC converters and adaptive clocking; and also 45nm EOS chips, which feature a dual core 64-bit RISC-V processor \citep{rv2core}. The two designs were used for separate research projects, but shared Rocket Chip code.

Rocket Chip is also a major component of Chipyard: an integrated SoC design, simulation and verification framework designed for agile development of specialised hardware. It includes Rocket Chip, but also accelerators such as the Hwacha vector unit generator and various domain-specific generators for cryptography, digital signal processing, and machine learning \citep{chipyard}.

\subsubsection{FPGAs}

Usually, a microcontroller design such as the one we intend to implement would be fabricated as an ASIC, so it can be integrated into board and other embedded systems. However, this is not an option for us as silicon fabrication is expensive and has to be done at scale. As such, we'll be using FPGAs for implementation. FPGAs are semiconductors based around matrices of configurable logic devices connected via programmable interconnect networks, which which allows them to be configured  \citep{whatisfpga}. This also suits the experimental nature of our project well, as it allows us to iterate on hardware designs and perform testing with relative ease. Chisel can be compiled to verilog designed to map to FPGAs \citep{chisel}, making them ideal for our use.

The hardware we have access to is a Xilinx Artix-7 100T on a Digilent Nexys A7 board \citep{digilent}, containing 15850 programmable logic slices. Preliminary testing has determined that this is enough space to fit a single 64-bit Rocket Core, alongside other interface hardware.

\subsection{Objectives}
Our goal is to expand on the prior work of current hardware devices and use Chisel to build open source programmable I/O devices, integrated with Rocket RISC-V cores to create a complete microcontroller. Implementation will target FPGAs, as this allows for rapid prototyping and easy implementation and testing of hardware. The requirements for the I/O device are summarised below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The device should be implemented using Chisel
	\item The device should have a small instruction memory for holding programs
	\item The device should be programmable using a simple DSL
	\item The device should execute instructions from it's memory in a standard fetch-decode-execute fashion
	\item Instructions should execute within a single cycle
	\item Instructions should either push data to the output pins, or shift data in from the pins
	\item The device should contain an interface for streaming data to/from a host device or external memory
	\item The device should be able to flexibly map inputs and outputs to external GPIO pins on the FPGA
\end{itemize}

The secondary goal, once the HDL implementation is complete and all requirements above are fulfilled, is to build a microcontroller integrating the devices using Rocket Chip. The requirements for this are summarised below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The microcontroller should contain at least one CPU core, programmable using the RISC-V ISA
	\item The microcontroller should be capable of executing instructions independently from the device
	\item The microcontroller should connect to the device over some bus, and be able to share data via a common memory or some other bus communication protocol
	\item The microcontroller should be capable of acting as a host for the devices, controlling initialisation and handling interrupts
	\item The microcontroller should be compact and efficient, using as little FPGA resources and power as possible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Timeline}

Table \ref{tab:timeline} gives a rough timeline for the project. Each of the tasks in the table is dependent upon the previous. There are a few notes of context for this:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Week 1 is the start of Term 1
	\item Week 15 is the start of Term 2
	\item The final report is due in Week 31
	\item The project work is weighted more heavily towards term 2, as I am taking more modules in term 1 than term 2.
\end{itemize}

		\hline
		\textbf{Week(s)} & \textbf{Task}                                                       \\ \hline

	\end{tabular}

	\label{tab:timeline}
\end{table}

\subsection{Methodology}

This project is very practical, and the bulk of our time will be spent writing and testing HDL code. As such, an appropriate software engineering methodology is required. Our approach will be very plan based, first laying out a high-level block design on paper, next moving to lay out skeleton HDL code, then writing the code one module at a time. Any iteration on the design will require going back to the block design, necessitating a waterfall-style approach to development. When it comes to implementing each individual module, we intend to take the opposite approach with a very flexible, agile methodology based on extreme programming with constant iteration and testing. This is made easy by the fact that the development team is only one person, and also do not have any external customers or stakeholders besides.

When it comes to testing, we intend to utilised test-driven development (TDD) heavily. Functional verification of hardware is very important, as it's much harder to tell to debug hardware designs than software, and synthesising and testing hardware on an FPGA can be time consuming. ChiselTest is a batteries-included a formal verification framework for Chisel that integrates with ScalaTest, the standard Scala testing framework, and with FIRRTL \citep{chiselverification}. The idea of TDD is that we can use ChiselTest to write the testbench before or alongside the module, and then implement the module with confidence that it works as intended. A comprehensive test suite will allow us to develop iteratively and with confidence.


\subsection{Resources}
There are a few hardware and software resources we'll need access to for completing the project. These are outlined in table \ref{tab:resources}, along with explanations for each. Free, open source software tools and libraries such as Chisel, Scala, and Rocket Chip are not included as they are freely and readily available due to their open source licenses.

\end{table}


\subsection{Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues}

There are some legal issues to consider, as we are developing hardware similar to other commercial hardware. Care must be taken to ensure that the devices we develop are sufficiently distinct from existing implementations, as not to infringe upon the terms of any existing licenses or patents. However, we do not believe this will be a problem for two reasons: our implementation will likely be very rudimentary in comparison, and we do not intend to sell, manufacture, or otherwise profit off any of the outcomes of this project.

Other social, ethical and professional issues have been considered, and there is nothing else to note. As this project does not require working with people, no ethical consent is required.
